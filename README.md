This repository contains an implementation of the DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm using Python's scikit-learn and pandas libraries. The code demonstrates how to perform clustering on a dataset loaded from a CSV file, visualize the results, and handle missing values
